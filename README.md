# MMiOS

##Synopsis

This project is a final work of Programming Technics 1 class, a OOP aproach. It consists in a Mobile Media for the 
iOS, developed using XCode and Swift 2. It is based on the project [MMAndroid](https://github.com/MMAndroid/MMAndroid), developed for the same class, but is rather a
new app then a adaptaion.

##Features

Right now the idea is to work on music and video. How deep the features based on these two aproaches will get depends on the flow of the project development.

##Installation

By now the only dependencies you will need is to have a XCode installed on your OS X system that does support Swift 2.

##Documentation

Soon.

##Contributors
